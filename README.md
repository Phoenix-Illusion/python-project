# python-project
Hello everyone, 
This is one of my favorate projects done, in which i have worked upon a voice assistant named as lucy. The programming language which i have used is python programming language.
So, basically this projects works like a voice assistant in which we give commands through voice and the program make sure that it gets executed. 
With the help of various libraries which am going to eleborate shortly, it is fun to see our work getting done so easily.
Below am going to elaborate some major libraries and its function in the program : 
1)Wolframalpha - It is a computational knowledge engine and answer engine developed by Wolfram Research. It answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced data.
2)Pyttsx3 - It is a library used for text-to-speech conversion and the best thing is it also works offline.
3) Speech recognition - As its name suggests it is used for speech recognition.
4) Shutil - Shutil module offers high-level operation on a file like a copy, create, and remote operation on the file.

Those were some most useful libraries or modules of python which we used in making this project. 
When we start the program it greets us according to the time, and then its ready to execute our commands we can add up endless bunch of codes to do our job in this accordingly. 
It has verious functions from accessing any apps, files, folders from our device to reaching out to all google services online. 
Also it is capable to update us from the news and weather forcast of the city. 
Frpm cracking funny jokes to giving humourous answers this program can serve you everything. 

As we all know human society is going towards ease of working, we all want to have our work done with more efficiency and less efforts. Well this was my first step towards that world of ease. While looking further to make it more useful and advance I'll look forward for your suggestions over this.
